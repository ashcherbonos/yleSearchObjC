# yleSearchObjC

yleSearch

Test project in Objective-C.
(Same project in Swift: https://github.com/ashcherbonos/yleSearch)

The task is to search programs from the Yle API:  http://developer.yle.fi/tutorials.html 

The application should have an input field where the user can provide what programs to search for (a search query).
The Finnish title of each result should be displayed in a scrollable list.
When submitting a search, only the first 10 results should be retrieved from the API.
When the user scrolls to the last few items in the list, the next 10 results should be appended to the list. An example for this type of scrolling can be seen on the desktop website of Facebook.
Pressing on the row should display more details about the program. For this you can select any 5 relevant fields from the JSON.
Tips: if you not familiar with Finnish tv-programs, try to search for "Octonautit" or just "Octo" - super popular tv-series (for age 3+)
